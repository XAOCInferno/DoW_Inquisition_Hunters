hello IDH-SS beta team,


This is the beta of Crimson Spire 2.0 for Soul Storm ONLY, this map is to be played Human vs Human only.

playing it against an AI is pointless, unless you just want to see the nis.

UCS, Nis Nislet, objectives description and dialogs :

The Crimson Spire2.0 scenarios calls upon dialogs contained in a new ucs file "Crimson_Spire_beta.ucs" located in
inquisition_daemonhunt\Locale\english 

NOTE: custom .ucs files added to the game causes sync error on multiplayer between
 players not having Crimson Spire 2.0 instaled on their computer and playing the IDH mod online with players who get Crimson instaled.
this means that having the Crimson_spire_beta.ucs file present on ones computer will break online compatibility.
 You wont be able to play with someone who do not has
the map instaled even if you are playing another map....



Instalation :

Just extract all the content to your SS main folder.
I wish you could play this map versus an human oponent,
because playing it vs the ai is not very interesting.



Some things to know about Crimson:

beware of the daemonic laugh : it is the warning that the blood pulse is going to be fired, any infantry unit will be killed if caught in the 
blast radius.
Vehicules are not afected so use your infantry transport carefully :)

NOTE / 

1)i added the hell talon blueprint  for chaos to the bloodpulse exception table, this is what makes Crimson Spire compatible with SS only.


2) to stop the blood pulse you need to capture the central strategic point.

3)The chaos player need to capture 8 psykers scatered around the chaos side of the map, it can be done by getting any chaos unit near a psyker. 
The ownership will be transfered to the player. I may add a delay to prevent furious capture/uncapture batttle and pings saturation on the minimap.

Once captured the chaos player has to send the psyker to the sould cage (the cage near the chaos hq player), 
the psyker will be ritualy teleported to the ritual place.
Once 8 psyker are gathered at the ritual place the warp gate will open and chaos reinforcement will start pouring out of the warp.
For the ritual to start the chaos player also  must capture his relic. (this is suppose to be like that, but the code is a bit unstable.)


NOTE /
objectives are now fully functional and working corectly at least for the Inquisition player; 
If someone manage to play a 2 human players game please report feedback.

JL
